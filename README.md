## **IMPORTANT NOTES**  
### **Recording**
Due to the large file size of the [**recordings**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QZcjFyvc0T7y5VDGqJf3IY8xilRa5uXX?usp=sharing), I uploaded them through google drive
Notice: You need to log in with your **Unimelb** Account  
Moreover, the lab2 and lab4 recording are missing, if you need it, please email me and I will re-record it otherwise I will do that during winter break, before August.
